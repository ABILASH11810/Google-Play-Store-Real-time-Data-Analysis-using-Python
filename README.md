This project focuses on analyzing real-time data from the Google Play Store using Python. It aims to understand how apps perform based on user ratings, reviews, number of installs, pricing, and update history. By cleaning and transforming the data, and applying sentiment analysis to user reviews, the project extracts meaningful insights about app quality, user satisfaction, and market trends.
The analysis is supported by interactive visualizations and a web dashboard, making it easy to explore patterns and compare apps across different categories. This kind of data-driven insight is valuable for app developers, marketers, and product managers to make smarter decisions and improve user experience.
